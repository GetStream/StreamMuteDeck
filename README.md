# Stream Video Chrome Extension for MuteDeck
![Integrating StreamDeck](https://github.com/GetStream/StreamMuteDeck/assets/39677/9f50a941-7c6b-4ac4-a0d4-7c8a7913b2e6)

This Chrome extension showcases controlling the Stream Video Demo using an [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/us/en) StreamDeck or similar hardware device.

It is required to have the [MuteDeck](https://mutedeck.com/) desktop app installed. MuteDeck is an application bridging the gap between browserbased calling applications and a hardware device like a StreamDeck. Beyond StreamDecks, MuteDeck also supports [LoupeDeck](https://loupedeck.com/) and [TouchPortal](https://www.touch-portal.com/).

## Getting Started

- Download and install the [MuteDeck app](https://mutedeck.com/downloads?ref=streamvideo)
- Install the [StreamDeck plugin](https://mutedeck.com/help/docs/plugins.html#installing-the-stream-deck-plugin?ref=streamvideo).
- Clone the StreamMuteDeck Chrome Extension repository to a local folder: `git clone https://github.com/GetStream/StreamMuteDeck.git`
- Copy the file `config.js.example` to `config.js`.
- Install the StreamMuteDeck Chrome Extension from your file system into your Chrome-based browser.

Installing and configuring the MuteDeck app and StreamDeck plugin shouldn‚Äôt be too hard.

However, installing an unpacked extension might require some explanation. Also, we have not released our extension to the Chrome Extension Store because it might make end users think it works for any website using Stream Video. (It does not.) But if you use Stream Video in your product, it should be straightforward to pick up our Chome Extension source code and adjust it to your situation.

Our StreamMuteDeck extension only works on our [Video SDK web demo instance](https://getstream.io/video/demos/) and our internal video calling system implemented using Stream Video, because the extension requests permissions for specific website URLs. When you‚Äôre following the steps below to build and distribute your own custom Chrome Extension, you‚Äôll change the website URL to match your own website. 

To install the StreamMuteDeck Chrome Extension:
- Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) on a Chrome browser.
- Enable the ‚ÄúDeveloper mode‚Äù toggle at the top right.
- Click the button at the top left called ‚ÄúInstall Unpacked Extension‚Äù
- In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the directory where you cloned the StreamMuteDeck Chrome extension repository.
